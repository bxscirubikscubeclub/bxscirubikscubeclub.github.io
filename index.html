    <h1 class="description">Welcome to Rubik's Cube Club!</h1>
    <p>In this club, you will learn how to solve Rubik's cubes, learn how to be fast at solving Rubik's cubes, and participate in competitions to earn rewards (usually food of some sort). Anyone can join this club! You don't have to know how to solve a Rubik's cube to begin with, you just need an interest for them and a desire to learn how to solve one.</p>

    <h1 class="description">Club information</h1>

    <h1 class="description">Other Things to Note</h1>
    <p>While it is recommended that you bring your own Rubik's cubes to the club, you do not have to; we can provide you with cubes. However, there probably will not be enough for everyone, so if you want to practice cubing, bring your own cube. Other than that, try not to bring in too much food to keep the place from becoming a mess.<br>Happy cubing!</p>

    <h1>What is this club?</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Rubik's Cube Club! In this club, we will teach you how to solve Rubik's cubes if you don't know how to, and we can show you how to get faster at solving Rubik's cubes if you already know howw to solve one. Best of all, we sometimes hold competitions to see who's the fastest, as well as who has improved over time.<br>This club is also very fun and chill. If you have something to do or want to talk, we don't mind, just don't bother others trying to do their own thing.</p>
